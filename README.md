# VSCode Native Debugger Extension

## Languages
The primary focus of this project are the C++ and Rust languages, for which CodeLLDB includes built-in visualizers for
vectors, strings, maps, and other standard library types.<br>
That said, it is usable with most other compiled languages whose compiler generates compatible debugging information,
such as Ada, Fortran, Kotlin Native, Nim, Objective-C, Pascal, [Swift](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb/wiki/Swift)
and Zig.

## Features
- Conditional breakpoints, function breakpoints, logpoints,
- Hardware data access breakpoints (watchpoints),
- Launch debuggee in integrated or external terminal,
- Disassembly view with instruction-level stepping,
- Loaded modules view,
- Python scripting,
- HTML rendering for advanced visualizations,
- Workspace-level defaults for launch configurations,
- Remote debugging,
- Reverse debugging (experimental, requires a compatible backend).

For full details please see [User's Manual](MANUAL.md).<br>
