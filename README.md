- Hardware data access breakpoints (watchpoints),
- Launch debuggee in integrated or external terminal,
- Disassembly view with instruction-level stepping,
- Loaded modules view,
- Python scripting,
- HTML rendering for advanced visualizations,
- Workspace-level defaults for launch configurations,

# Languages
The primary focus of this project are the C++ and Rust languages, for which CodeLLDB includes built-in visualizers for
vectors, strings, maps, and other standard library types.<br>
That said, it is usable with most other compiled languages whose compiler generates compatible debugging information,
such as Ada, Fortran, Kotlin Native, Nim, Objective-C, Pascal, [Swift](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb/wiki/Swift)
and Zig.

# Supported Platforms

## Host
- Linux with glibc 2.18+ for x86_64, aarch64 or armhf.
- MacOS X 10.10+ for x86_64 and 11.0+ for arm64.
- Windows 10 and 11 for x86_64. [See Windows notes in wiki!](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb/wiki/Windows)
  - Windows 10 and 11 arm64 is supported, but requires [building from source](./BUILDING.md#arm64-windows).

## Target
CodeLLDB supports AArch64, ARM, AVR, MSP430, RISCV, X86 architectures and may be used to debug on embedded platforms
via [remote debugging](MANUAL.md#remote-debugging).
